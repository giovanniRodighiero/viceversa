# Challenge description
Write a SPA with React.js or Vue.js that:
- implement the BackendService snippets to get the metrics from the server (use "challengeApiKey" as the apiKey ).
- on one page allows the user to view, add, edit and delete the metrics.
- on another page show the user the metrics as you prefer.
- preferably avoid using css frameworks like bootstrap.
- write meaningful tests (bonus points).
- create a git repository and share it with us.
Structure the code as you would do for a production application, expecting in the future that the BackendService will provide new kind of Metric class.
